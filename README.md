Packet Flow Visualizer using Cisco Packet Tracer

Solution to the problem statement given as a part of Cisco VIP 2023 Cybersecurity Pathway

The objectives of the project could be divided in two parts:

  i.  Creating a network topology to suit the needs of a college network

  ii. To collect packets at each device using a packet sniffer


Details about the project: 

>  The entire network is divided into 4 parts: CS Lab, Library, Board room and Director's office. 

>  The IP addresses are a part of a Subnet with network id 192.168.10.0/26. 

  >>  CS lab has 3 PCs (2 for students, and 1 for faculty).

  >>  Library has 3 PCs, 1 Printer and a Wireless Router which provides a WiFi network with SSID and is protected by a passphrase.

  >>  Board Room has 2 PCs and a Printer.

  >>  Director's Office has a PC, a Laptop and a Printer. 

>  The devices are connected within their LANs with a Switch.

>  The LANs are connected with Routers using RIPv2 protocol.

>  Sniffers are used in a few places to capture and analyse packets from different nodes.

>  Relevant information can be extracted from the packet headers, noting changes mainly in the Ethernet and IP headers.
